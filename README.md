# Mergesort In All Languages



Hi,

I have been following you since 1 week now. I do not agree with most of your things. I am a journalist at a local newspaper.

I believe that masks are very important for covid. I have seen a lot of evidence in a lot of reputed news websites. With great power, comes a great responsibility. My friend at NYTimes is doing a story on pseudo-intilictuals who think covis is a sham, and people who are against masks, vaccines etc. She will surely mention comma.ai as well. 

Also, I think you are an anti-nationalist. You come from a hacking background, so you dont care. I hope you know hacking is illegal and unethical. It is bc of people like you Apple had to spend $$$ to improve the security. They could have used it for better things. Like paying more to foxconn workers. Hackers do not reailze that what they do is not smart - goto YT and search "how to hack gmail" you will see 100s of vids. It seemed pretty easy to me. 

Who has given you a right to hack apple or sony, costing them billiions. Who has given you the right to say covid is a sham?? You also attack Christianity in your livestreams.  You offend a lot of people .if you dont want to be a man of faith dont be. But dont make fun of others. 

PS: companies like Google are proof why America is great, you have no right to diss them.



I am not coder and my cousin who is in IT support suggested me to contact you here.



Are you tired of unsorted arrays? Do you wanna smash your keyboard when you see the array:

> :facepunch::construction::hear_no_evil:[5,9,1,3,4,6,6,3,2]:facepunch::construction::hear_no_evil:<br>

Well look no further!<br/>

## More seriously

Our goal is to compare the length and "complexity" of the same code in many different languages. Which language is the best? Now we can know.

Functional languages like Scheme and Haskell seem to make much smaller code than Rust, Dart and C#.

And then there's [J](https://www.jsoftware.com/#/README), which has a 3 line solution. The jury is out if it's readable though.

## Getting started

Don't know [merge sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort).<br>
Pick up a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) and try to implement it yourself
 
## Running all of the versions
 
 Install everything you need and run: `./run.sh`

## Pull Requests

 Make sure you have your language running in CI and it uses the list [5,9,1,3,4,6,6,3,2]

 New policy: We will only be fixing bugs in already submitted languages. Want to join, pick a new language!
